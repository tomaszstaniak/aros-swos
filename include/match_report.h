/*
 * match_report.h -- after an online match, one zip of both players' logs and ratings
 * (docs/NETPLAY_REPORT.md, include/report_proto.h). SDL builds only.
 *
 * When a match is over and HOW WAS THE MATCH? has been answered, each player's game
 * sends its SWOS.log, deflated, with the rating and comment, to the other player over
 * the lobby's link. Each then writes the same zip --
 *
 *     save/netplay/2026-09-27_211405_PREDICADOR_vs_ELSHEIMY.zip
 *         SWOS_player1.log     the host's SWOS.log
 *         SWOS_player2.log     the joiner's
 *         rating.txt           the match, both ratings and comments, both builds
 *
 * -- keeps the last REPORT_KEEP of them, and sends it to the matchmaking server, which
 * files it by match id. A player that leaves before the other has answered still gets
 * a zip, with what there is.
 *
 * SEND MATCH REPORTS (MULTIPLAYER SETTINGS, [netplay] reports) is the consent: off,
 * nothing leaves the machine -- no log to the other player, nothing to the server --
 * and the zip holds only this player's own log. On by default in tester builds only.
 * Where the upload goes: SWOS_REPORTS=off|server|host[:port] for a test -- which also
 * turns reports on (or off) whatever the setting -- else the server this build logs in to. The automated tests never upload unless SWOS_REPORTS
 * says where, and the web build never does.
